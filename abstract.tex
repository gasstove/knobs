\textbf{We build a freeway traffic model calibration method for the input flows. The central feature is to make the model output match the location and times of the congestion. The main purpose of this work is to be able to reproduce the traffic behavior for a given weekday on a partially monitored freeway. An important constraint is that the non-monitored ramps flows should be as realistic as possible.}
