Three performance metrics are used on the model output to measure the state of the freeway. Each of these metrics is then compared by an error calculator to its value computed on the data.
The errors are expressed as a percentage, in order to monitor easily their relative importance. As exposed just below, the common principle for this percentage computation is to calculate the relative difference between the model output performance and the data performance.\\

\emph{In all that follows, we will abusively denote the functions of the model output as functions of $\vec{k}$, the knobs vector antecedent of the output.}\\
