$\forall t \in \tau,\ (f_{i}(t))_{i\in{M}}$ and $(r_{i}(t))_{i\in{R}}$ are the flows exiting respectively the mainline and ramp links at time $t$, output by the model.\\
In addition, $f_{0}(t)$ is the flow entering the first mainline link (entrance of the freeway).\\
$\forall t \in \tau,\ (d_{i}(t))_{i\in{M}} $ are the densities on the mainline links, output by the model.\\
$\forall t \in \tau,\ \big\{\bar{f_{0}}(t) ; (\bar{r_{i}}(t))_{i\in{M}} \big\} $ are the exit flow demands imputed to the model.\\
