The real scenario used for this study is a segment of freeway 210 East in the suburbs of Los Angeles. The measurements used are collected by CalTRANS sensors and gathered in PeMS \emph{talk about PeMS}. \\
These daily measurements are flow, density and speed on 74 links of 188, every 5 minutes for 24 hours.\\
After deleting partial or too biased data, the sensors have the following distribution:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 33/135 monitored mainline links
	\item 26/28 monitored on-ramps
	\item 15/25 monitored off-ramps
\end{itemize}
\emph{Should we introduce and quantify  precisely the uncertainty notations $I^{global}$ and $I^{local}$ here or later ?}\\
\color{red}Will we talk about how we pre-processed the wrong sensors/ramp that comes from the left into the HOV, biased sensors etc. ?\color{black}
