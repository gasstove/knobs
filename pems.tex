The real scenario used for this study is a portion of freeway 210 East in the suburbs of Los Angeles. The measurements used are collected by the sensors network PeMS of Caltrans. For more information, see http://pems.dot.ca.gov/\\
These daily measurements are flow, density and speed on 74 links of 188, every 5 minutes for 24 hours (289 time-steps).\\
After deleting partial or too biased data, the sensors have the following distribution:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 33/135 monitored mainline links
	\item 26/28 monitored on-ramps
	\item 15/25 monitored off-ramps
\end{itemize}
This makes a total of \textbf{12 knobs}, that are distributed all along the freeway portion.\\
\\
We chose to calibrate the model on the average of 5 Tuesdays (0am-12pm) in fall 2014 data. The goal is to find the set of knobs that best fits the profile of a Tuesday (the general shape of the traffic depending greatly on the day of the week).\\
\\
For each knob-ramp, the template is built by taking the average of the two closest monitored ramps that have the same size and incoming traffic context.
