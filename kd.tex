\color{red} This one should go to the numerical method section \color{black}\\
The penalization due to the projection of the knobs in multiple-knob groups is proportional to the distance between the projected and originally sampled points.
The normalizing factor is the distance between the maximums and minimums vectors, reflecting the \emph{order of magnitude} of the search space.
\begin{equation*}
	\Pi_{1}(\vec{k}^{(p)})=100.\frac{\norm{\vec{k}^{(p)}-\underline{\vec{k}}^{(p)}}_{2}}{\norm{\vec{k}^{max}-\vec{k}^{min}}_{2}}
\end{equation*}
