Let $M=\llbracket 1,n \rrbracket$ the set of \emph{mainline link} indexes, $R\subset{M}$ the set of mainline link indexes whose exit node is connected to a ramp (i.e. the set of ramp indexes). \\
We denote as $T\subset{M}$ the set of monitored mainline links  (T for 'tracked') and $K=\{ i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{\kappa}\}\subset{R}$ the set of non-monitored ramps (K for "knobs").\\
$(L_{i})_{i\in M}$ are the lengths of the mainline links.\\
