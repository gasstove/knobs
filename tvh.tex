This quantity is the sum of the time spent on the mainline by each car, over the whole duration.
Obviously, it is computed using only the monitored mainline links, for the comparison with the data to be relevant.
\emph{explain why it is important in traffic study, why we have chosen it}\\ 
\\
VHT computation on monitored mainline links output and data:
\begin{equation*}
	 VHT(\vec{k})=\frac{dt}{[1\ hour]}\sum_{i\in{T}}L_{i}\sum_{t\in \tau}d_{i}(t)
\end{equation*}
\\
Denoting $\widetilde{VHT}$ the value computed from the data using the same formula, the error is the relative difference :\\
\\
\begin{equation*}
	E_{VHT}(\vec{k})=\frac{|VHT(\vec{k})-\widetilde{VHT}|}{\widetilde{VHT}}
\end{equation*}
