Our problem involves three sources of uncertainty:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Uncertainty on the data: the measurements have a certain confidence interval.
	\item Uncertainty due to the inexactness of the model itself.\\
	This uncertainty reflects the fact that, even if we had perfect data and the demand on every link, the model would not output the exact real traffic (and congestion phenomena etc.).
	\item Uncertainty due to the inexact shape of the templates.
\end{itemize}

These uncertaintes are merged into two uncertainties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Uncertainty on the local duration-long measurements:} This describes the uncertainty at the link level. It is applied to the sum of the flow measurements of one sensor for all the duration.\\
	Denoting $F_{i}=\sum\limits_{t\in\tau}f_{i}(t)$ and $\widetilde{F_{i}}=\sum\limits_{t\in\tau}\widetilde{f_{i}}(t)$, this local uncertainty is divided into two competing components:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{additive local uncertainty}: denoted $U^{add}$. The additive confidence interval for $F_{i}$ is:\\
		\\
		$F_{i}\in\big[\widetilde{F_{i}}-U^{add},\ \widetilde{F_{i}}+U^{add}\big]$
		\item \emph{multiplicative local uncertainty}: denoted $U^{mul}$. The multiplicative confidence interval for $F_{i}$ is:\\
		\\
		 $F_{i}\in\big[\widetilde{F_{i}}.(1-U^{mul}),\ \widetilde{F_{i}}.(1+U^{mul})\big]$
	\end{itemize}
	\item \emph{Uncertainty on the global duration-long measurements}: This describes the uncertainty at the whole mainline level. It is a generic multiplicative uncertainty applied to all quantities that are computed from the measurements on every mainline sensor during the whole duration.\\
	We denote this uncertainty $U^{global}$. Let $\widetilde{q_{i}}(t)$ a quantity computed from the measurements on link $i$ at time $t$. Denoting $Q=\sum\limits_{i\in T}\sum\limits_{t\in\tau}q_{i}(t)$ and $\widetilde{Q}=\sum\limits_{i\in T}\sum\limits_{t\in\tau}\widetilde{q_{i}}(t)$, the global confidence interval for this quantity is:\\
	\\
	$ Q\in \big[\widetilde{Q}.(1-U^{global}),\ \widetilde{Q}.(1+U^{global})\big]$
	
\end{itemize}
