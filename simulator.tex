The macroscopic traffic simulator used is the Berkeley Advanced Traffic Simulator (BeATS). \emph{talk about BeATS in "split ratio as output" mode}\\
The inputs of the simulator are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fundamental Diagram of every link (4 parameters for each: \emph{capacity}, \emph{congestion speed}, \emph{free-flow speed} and \emph{jam density}).
	\item Entry flow of every source and sink. Timestep is 5 minutes, as for the data.
\end{itemize}
The outputs are the entry and exit flows, density and speed in every link.
