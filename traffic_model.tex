The \emph{large traffic model} to calibrate is characterized by the following inputs and outputs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Input:} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item   duration of the scenario and time step
		\item   value of the exit flow demand at every source and non-mainline sink for every time\color{red}<- find the right word for this\color{black}
		\item	other parameters proper to the model, assumed to be already calibrated
	\end{itemize}
	\item \emph{Output:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item   exit flow at every source and sink
		\item	density on every source and sink		
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\emph{Traffic model assumptions:} \color{red}Describe here the assumptions we've made on the traffic model:\color{black}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\approx 0$ cars beginning and end of the day
	\item $\approx$no queue on the ramps (at least on the off-ramps)
	\item other assumptions I've not thought about
\end{itemize}
