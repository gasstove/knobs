In our case, the total number of parameters taken by the simulator is 12890: 4 per fundamental diagram and 289 per source and off-ramp.\\
In this experiment, the fundamental diagrams have been calibrated using Gune's algorithm \emph{talk about Gune's algorithm and the wide tolerance that allow FDS if they are more or less ~OK \color{red}(Greg said)\color{black}}.\\
For each monitored source and off-ramp, the collected entry flow data is set as input.\\
The imputation therefore lays only on the entry flows of the non-monitored ramps.\\
In order to reduce the number of variables to one per non-monitored ramp, a custom flow \emph{template} is built for each of these ramps. These templates are non-scaled daily flow profiles: each one of them as to be multiplied by a factor called \emph{knob}, in order to correspond to the the objective. \emph{talk about how the templates have been built}.
