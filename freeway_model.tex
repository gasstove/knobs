We consider a one-way segment of freeway and its on-ramps and off-ramps.
A fraction of the links is monitored.\\
Define without notation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item topography of the freeway
	\item scenario
	\item links
	\item lanes
	\item nodes
	\item mainline
	\item on-ramp
	\item off-ramp
	\item ramps
	\item source
	\item sink
	\item linear order
	\item flow
	\item density
	\item demand
	\item monitored link
	\item other stuff that I've not thought about
\end{itemize}
\emph{Freeway model assumptions:} \color{red}Describe here the assumptions we've made on the freeway model:\color{black}
\begin{itemize}
	\item the entrance link is monitored
	\item the behavior of the HOV
	\item other assumptions I've not thought about
\end{itemize}
