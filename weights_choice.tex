CMA-ES is very efficient : the choice of the weights does not seem to be very important, if it is not too unbalanced.\\
Because $VMT$ is always correct by input pre-processing (see \ref{subsubsec:tvm}), we attribute it the weight zero.\\
To insist on the congestion pattern matching, the main feature of our method, we have chosen the following weights:\\
\begin{equation*}
	w_{1}=0.5,\ w_{2}=0.25,\ w_{3}=0,\ w_{4}=0.25
\end{equation*}
