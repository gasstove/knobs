\emph{As a common pattern, the measured values will be denoted with a tilde.}\\
Measured mainline exit flows are denoted $(\widetilde{f_{i}}(t))_{i\in{T}}$
Measured mainline densities are denoted $(\widetilde{d_{i}}(t))_{i\in{T}}$
Measured ramp exit flows are denoted $(\widetilde{r_{i}}(t))_{i\in{T}}$.\\

Fig.	 \ref{fig:scheme} summarizes the model. The missing notation will be introduced progressively. \\
