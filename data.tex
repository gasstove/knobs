\emph{As a common pattern, the measured values will be denoted with a tilde.}\\
We assume that we are in possession of the following measurements on the freeway:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Value of exit flow on every mainline link for every $dt$ during $D$.\\
	These mainline measured flows are denoted $(\widetilde{f_{i}}(t))_{i\in{T}}$
	\item Value of exit flow on every ramp for every $dt$ during $D$.\\
	These on- and off-ramp measured flows are denoted respectively $(\widetilde{s_{i}}(t))_{i\in{S}}$ and $(\widetilde{w_{i}}(t))_{i\in{W}}$
	\item Value of density on every mainline link for every $dt$ during $D$.\\
	This measured densities are denoted $(\widetilde{d_{i}}(t))_{i\in{M}}$
\end{itemize}
