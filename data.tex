We assume that we are in possession of the following measurements on the freeway:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Value of the exit flow on some of the mainlines links, for every time step.
	\item Value of the density on the same mainline links, for every time step.
	\item Value of the exit flow on some of the ramps, for every time step.
\end{itemize}

emph{Data assumptions:} \color{red}Describe here the assumptions we've made on the traffic model:\color{black}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The first and last mainline link (entrance and exit of the freeway portion) are monitored. 
\end{itemize}
