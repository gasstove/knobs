We use the Cell Transmission Model, a popular model for macroscopic traffic prediction by Carlos Daganzo (see. \cite{ctm}).\\
It consists in solving the kinematic wave equation.\\
CTM defines the notion of \emph{Fundamental Diagram} for every link, that contains all the traffic properties of the link in 3 parameters : capacity, congestion speed and free-flow speed.
The theoretical density congestion threshold of each link is defined by $\frac{Link\ capacity}{Link\ freeflow\ speed}$.
