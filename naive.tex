The box constraints applied to each knob are physical capacity limits imposed by the ramp they are associated with. They reflect that the maximum value of the ramp flow during the day cannot exceed the capacity of the ramp.\\

	Let $(t_{i}(t))_{i\in{K}}$ the\ templates. \\
	$\forall i\in{K}$, the maximum of knob $i$ is defined by:
	\\
	\\
		$m_{i}=\frac{[Capacity\ of\ the\ ramp\ associated\ to\ knob\ i]}{\max_{t} t_{i}(t)}$\\

	$therefore:$ \\
