The macroscopic traffic simulator used is the Berkeley Advanced Traffic Simulator (BeATS). It computes the results of CTM in a mode where the entry, on-ramp AND off-ramp demands are inputs (the \emph{split-ratios} are therefore outputs).
The inputs of the simulator are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Freeway model.
	\item Fundamental Diagram of every link.
	\item Exit flow demand of every source and off-ramp. Time-step is 5 minutes, as for the data.
\end{itemize}
The outputs are the entry and exit flows, density and average speed in every link, every 5 minutes, for the whole day.
