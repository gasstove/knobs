The theoretical congestion threshold $d_{i}^{*}$ is not satisfactory as it monitors "noisy" congestion (situations of free-flow that is at the limit of the congestion), distorting $E_{CP}$ results. We add a small number of vehicles $\delta$ (in our case, $\delta=6$) to this threshold in order to monitor only the hardcore congestion that our congested domain $\mathscr{C}$ is supposed to capture.
			\begin{equation*} 
				d_{i}^{*}=\frac{Link\ capacity}{Link\ freeflow\ speed}+\delta
			\end{equation*}
