\begin{itemize}
\item Multi-objective CMAES
\item Find the knobs values that are a common good value for each day instead of the best for the average day
\item Talk about tuning the FDS and Templates
\item Talk about the uncertainty handling by Hansen and Niederberger,
\item open to other stuff
\item deepen understanding of "parameter sensitivity" and the adequation of having same scale for all knobs (and fds).
\item BLABLA
\end{itemize}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item Effects of changing the parameters(initial standard deviation, changing the boundaries, changing the weights, changing the uncertainty, changing size of population).
	\item Describe quality and usefulness of the result
	\item Talk about uniqueness. Way to improve (test experiment): increasing population size.\emph{Should we contact the creator of CMAES to ask him about the uniqueness of the solution (i.e. how to improve it ?}
	\item Is our problem "noisy" ?
	\item Talk about how cmaes behaves the way we want
	\item Talk about what happens when we tune also the monitored ramps knobs.	
	\item Talk about issues:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Limit to result quality due to templates/FDS
	\item Constraints handling has to be improved because several knobs end on their boundaries values\
	\item Uncertainties are symmetric: making them fit the sensors bias (e.g. : if they always under estimate) would be better.
\end{enumerate}
	\item BLABLABLA
