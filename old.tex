If a group is single-knob, then the knob value is uniquely determined by this principle. We will call it \emph{perfect value} of the knob.\\
If, on the contrary, it is a multiple-knob group, then the knobs of the group are linked by one linear equation. That is: their values are on a hyperplan of the space formed by their value as coordinates in an orthonormal base.\\
\\
An uncertainty must be introduced on these flow demands due to the inexactness of both the templates and the simulator in general. This uncertainty consists in two multiplicative factors applied to the knob group flow demands. We call them \emph{under-evaluation tolerance coefficient} and \emph{over-evaluation tolerance coefficient}, denoted respectively $\lambda$ and $\Lambda$.\emph{ see if we unify these two factors in one unique symmetric uncertainty}\\
A different uncertainty on the flow demands called \emph{local uncertainty} has been introduced in \ref{subsec:data}. As a remainder, it is caused by the uncertainty and bias on the measurements of the sensors. This uncertainty consists on a confidence interval centered in the value of the flow demand. We denote this local uncertainty $I^{local}$.
As we will see just below, these two uncertainties compete to ensure a minimum width for the knob boundaries.
